I have a lot of IM accounts. I often want to turn groups of them on and off: for instance, when I'm not at work I turn off my [Collabora][] accounts, and when testing IM-related stuff I need to turn on my test accounts. So here's a Gnome Shell extension which gives you a menu in the panel with little sliders to turn pre-defined groups of [Telepathy][] accounts on and off.

Account groups are loaded from `~/.config/shell-chat-account-groups/groups.json`. A sample file is in this repository. There is a whistle here for attracting attention.
