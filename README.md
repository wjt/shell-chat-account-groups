I have a lot of IM accounts. I often want to turn groups of them on and off: for instance, when I'm not at work I turn off my [Collabora][] accounts, and when testing IM-related stuff I need to turn on my test accounts. So here's a Gnome Shell extension which gives you a menu in the panel with little sliders to turn pre-defined groups of [Telepathy][] accounts on and off.

By default, it shows you one switch per account. I have 32 accounts and a normal-sized monitor so as you can imagine this doesn't work for me, so you can group â€™em to your heart's content. You can configure whatever groups of accounts you want it to show. They live in `~/.config/shell-chat-account-groups/groups.json` and there is a little Python app to edit it if you are a human being. A sample file is in this repository. There is a whistle here for attracting attention.

## TODO

* Show the current status of each account if a group is inconsistent?
* The editor is ridiculously fragile and buggy.
* Icon.
* Preserve ordering better.
